# FisherInformationInV1V2MT

This repository contains the code and (most of) the data from the report:

Transformations of sensory information in the brain suggest changing criteria for optimality
Tyler S. Manning, Emma Alexander, Bruce G. Cumming, Gregory C. DeAngelis, Xin Huang, Emily A. Cooper

Code: The "analysisPipeline" script provides a walk through of the analyses, so that is the place to start.

Physiology data: The physiology data are already in the "dataPhysio" subdirectory, which has it's own README describing the data format.

Disparity statistics data: The disparity statistics dataset is too big for Github. It can be downloaded from: https://osf.io/eb6tq/
After downloading, these files should be placed in a sub-directory called "dataSceneStats."
